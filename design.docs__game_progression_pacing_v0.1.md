## \uc0\u55356 \u57263  Overview of Progression & Pacing\
The explicit game structure clearly divided into progressive phases, each designed for optimal player engagement, explicit clarity, and balanced competitive/cooperative dynamics.\
\
## \uc0\u9203  Explicit Phase-by-Phase Breakdown\
\
### \uc0\u55357 \u56633  Phase 1: Initial/Tutorial (0-5 mins)\
- **Purpose**: Explicit onboarding and tutorializing of game mechanics.\
- **Activities**:\
  - AI explicitly introduces roles, skills, and objectives.\
  - Simple introductory puzzle solved cooperatively to familiarize with interface and adaptive breadcrumbs.\
- **AI Role**: Clear and explicit tutorial guidance; minimal adaptive difficulty.\
- **KPIs**:\
  - \uc0\u8805  90% players understand roles/mechanics explicitly after this phase.\
  - Clarity rating explicitly \uc0\u8805  4.5/5.\
\
---\
\
### \uc0\u55357 \u56632  Phase 2: Early Game (5-10 mins)\
- **Purpose**: Explicit initiation of competitive dynamics and cognitive engagement.\
- **Activities**:\
  - Evidence Analysis Duel explicitly starts competitive engagement.\
  - Winner explicitly begins RCA hypothesis registration.\
  - Loser explicitly introduces initial decoy clues.\
- **AI Role**: \
  - Adaptive breadcrumbs explicitly scale initial difficulty.\
  - Provides timely clue summaries explicitly.\
- **KPIs**:\
  - Player engagement explicitly maintained at \uc0\u8805  85%.\
  - Early cognitive challenge satisfaction explicitly \uc0\u8805  4/5.\
\
---\
\
### \uc0\u55357 \u56633  Phase 3: Mid-Game (Cooperative Integration) (10-15 mins)\
- **Purpose**: Explicit cooperative relief from competition; deepens social interaction and curiosity-driven narrative.\
- **Activities**:\
  - "Digital Decoding" cooperative challenge explicitly triggered at ~13 mins.\
  - Explicit mandatory sharing of partial identity-related clues.\
  - Structured resolution of contradictions explicitly cooperatively.\
- **AI Role**: \
  - Explicitly manages mandatory communication and adaptive hint deployment.\
  - Adjusts explicitly cooperative puzzle complexity based on team performance.\
- **KPIs**:\
  - Cooperative challenge completion explicitly \uc0\u8805  80%.\
  - Player satisfaction with cooperative interaction explicitly \uc0\u8805  4.5/5.\
\
---\
\
### \uc0\u55357 \u56632  Phase 4: End-Game/Final Submission (15-20 mins)\
- **Purpose**: Explicit competitive climax; RCA validation and identity deduction explicitly culminate in definitive resolution.\
- **Activities**:\
  - Explicit Identity Deduction Face-Off explicitly drives strategic final guesses.\
  - RCA Verification explicitly conducted; Winner explicitly finalizes Root-Cause Report.\
  - Loser explicitly leverages final contradictions and forced debates.\
- **AI Role**: \
  - Explicitly neutral validation of identity guesses withheld until Final Submission.\
  - Explicit consensus validation and contradiction highlighting.\
- **KPIs**:\
  - Explicit tension satisfaction explicitly \uc0\u8805  4.5/5.\
  - Identity deduction accuracy explicitly \uc0\u8805  50%.\
  - Explicit balanced win-rate explicitly maintained (approx. 55%-45%).\
