## üéØ Overview of Progression & Pacing
The explicit game structure clearly divided into progressive phases, each designed for optimal player engagement, explicit clarity, and balanced competitive/cooperative dynamics.

## ‚è≥ Explicit Phase-by-Phase Breakdown

### üîπ Phase 1: Initial/Tutorial (0-5 mins)
- **Purpose**: Explicit onboarding and tutorializing of game mechanics.
- **Activities**:
  - AI explicitly introduces roles, skills, and objectives.
  - Simple introductory puzzle solved cooperatively to familiarize with interface and adaptive breadcrumbs.
  - AI explicitly presents tweet.
  - Explicit Pre-Discussion Statements phase (‚âÉ30 sec): Players explicitly set initial stances and misinformation.
  - Explicit Pre-Discussion Statements phase (‚âÉ30 sec): Players explicitly set initial stances and misinformation.
  - Winner explicitly selects tweet truth stance ("True" or "False").
  - Explicit Post-Discussion Reflection phase (‚âÉ30 sec): Players explicitly log truthful summaries or strategic deceptions.
  - Explicitly logged selection clearly guides RCA focus.
- **AI Role**: Clear and explicit tutorial guidance; minimal adaptive difficulty.
- **KPIs**:
  - ‚â• 90% players understand roles/mechanics explicitly after this phase.
  - Clarity rating explicitly ‚â• 4.5/5.


---

### üî∏ Phase 2: Early Game (5-10 mins)
- **Purpose**: Explicit initiation of competitive dynamics and cognitive engagement.
- **Activities**:
  - Explicit Pre-Discussion Statements (‚âÉ30 sec): Players explicitly state positions or misinformation explicitly before competitive engagements.
  - Evidence Analysis Duel explicitly starts competitive engagement.
  - Winner explicitly begins RCA hypothesis registration.
  - Loser explicitly introduces initial decoy clues.
  - Explicit Post-Discussion Reflection (‚âÉ30 sec): Players explicitly reflect and strategically log deceptive or truthful statements explicitly.

- **AI Role**: 
  - Adaptive breadcrumbs explicitly scale initial difficulty.
  - Provides timely clue summaries explicitly.
- **KPIs**:
  - Player engagement explicitly maintained at ‚â• 85%.
  - Early cognitive challenge satisfaction explicitly ‚â• 4/5.

---

### üîπ Phase 3: Mid-Game (Cooperative Integration) (10-15 mins)
- **Purpose**: Explicit cooperative relief from competition; deepens social interaction and curiosity-driven narrative.
- **Activities**:
- Explicit Pre-Discussion Statements explicitly prior to cooperative engagement (‚âÉ30 sec).
  - "Digital Decoding" cooperative challenge explicitly triggered at ~13 mins.
  - Explicit mandatory sharing of partial identity-related clues.
  - Structured resolution of contradictions explicitly cooperatively.
  - Explicit Post-Discussion Reflection phase explicitly following cooperative puzzle-solving (‚âÉ30 sec).

- **AI Role**: 
  - Explicitly manages mandatory communication and adaptive hint deployment.
  - Adjusts explicitly cooperative puzzle complexity based on team performance.
- **KPIs**:
  - Cooperative challenge completion explicitly ‚â• 80%.
  - Player satisfaction with cooperative interaction explicitly ‚â• 4.5/5.

---

### üî∏ Phase 4: End-Game/Final Submission (15-20 mins)
- **Purpose**: Explicit competitive climax; RCA validation and identity deduction explicitly culminate in definitive resolution.
- **Activities**:
- Explicit Pre-Discussion Statements explicitly framing final competitive stance (‚âÉ30 sec).
  - Explicit Identity Deduction Face-Off explicitly drives strategic final guesses.
  - RCA Verification explicitly conducted; Winner explicitly finalizes Root-Cause Report.
  - Loser explicitly leverages final contradictions and forced debates.
  - Explicit Post-Discussion Reflection phase explicitly to summarize final positions and strategies (‚âÉ30 sec).

- **AI Role**: 
  - Explicitly neutral validation of identity guesses withheld until Final Submission.
  - Explicit consensus validation and contradiction highlighting.
- **KPIs**:
  - Explicit tension satisfaction explicitly ‚â• 4.5/5.
  - Identity deduction accuracy explicitly ‚â• 50%.
  - Explicit balanced win-rate explicitly maintained (approx. 55%-45%).
