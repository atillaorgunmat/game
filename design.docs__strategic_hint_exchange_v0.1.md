## \uc0\u55356 \u57263  Explicit Purpose\
Define the precise structure, mechanics, timing, and impact of strategic hint exchanges explicitly among players, enhancing curiosity-driven deduction, collaboration, and strategic gameplay depth.\

## \uc0\u55357 \u56524  Explicit Hint Exchange Structure Overview\
\
| Hint Type              | Explicit Purpose                             | Timing & Conditions                 |\
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\
| **Capability Hints**   | Players explicitly share cryptic hints about their chosen capabilities. | Mandatory during cooperative phases |\
| **Identity Hints**     | Explicitly share partial identity clues to enhance strategic deduction. | Triggered explicitly during late-game phases |\
| **Strategic Decoys**   | Explicitly misleading hints intentionally shared by Loser to confuse the Winner. | Strategically throughout competitive phases |\

\
## \uc0\u55357 \u56589  Detailed Breakdown by Hint Exchange Type\
\
### \uc0\u55357 \u56633  Capability Hints\
- **Explicit Role:** Foster strategic transparency, enhance collaboration, explicitly deepen persona-driven interactions.\
- **Example Hint:** "I'm particularly good at verifying early suspicions." (Hint: "Register Hypothesis" capability)\
- **Timing:** Explicitly mandatory during mid-game cooperative phases:contentReference[oaicite:3]\{index=3\}.\
\
### \uc0\u55357 \u56632  Identity Hints\
- **Explicit Role:** Enhance explicit curiosity-driven identity deduction.\
- **Example Hint:** "My working hours differ from most of the team." (Partial clue hinting timezone differences):contentReference[oaicite:4]\{index=4\}.\
- **Timing:** Explicitly during Identity Deduction Face-Off, late mid-game competitive phase:contentReference[oaicite:5]\{index=5\}.\
\
### \uc0\u55357 \u56633  Strategic Decoys\
- **Explicit Role:** Introduce explicit confusion and strategic misdirection.\
- **Example Decoy Hint:** "I'm adept at quickly resolving contradictions," when the player actually specializes in creating contradictions.\
- **Timing:** Explicitly used by Loser strategically during competitive phases.\

## \uc0\u55356 \u57238  Explicit Integration with Game Pillars\
\
| Pillar                 | Explicit Hint Exchange Alignment              |\
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\
| **Curiosity**          | Capability and identity hints explicitly sustain curiosity and strategic questioning. |\
| **Collaboration**      | Explicit capability hint-sharing fosters structured teamwork explicitly. |\
| **Root-Cause Analysis**| Explicit capability hints directly support effective RCA collaboration and validation. |\

## \uc0\u55357 \u56421  Explicit Alignment with Player Personas\
\
| Persona                | Explicit Hint Alignment                        | Justification                               |\
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\
| **Curious Collaborator** | Capability hints, identity hints explicitly    | Sustains explicit engagement, inclusivity explicitly |\
| **Analytical Achiever**  | Capability hints explicitly support structured strategy | Intellectual satisfaction and mastery explicitly |\
| **Social Trickster**     | Strategic decoys explicitly enable deception   | Explicitly enhances strategic social gameplay |\

\
## \uc0\u55358 \u56598  Explicit AI Supporter Role in Hint Exchanges\
- **Validate Hints:** Explicitly manages and validates partial hints provided by players.\
- **Adaptive Clarity:** Explicitly clarifies or complicates hints as needed to balance gameplay fairness and strategic depth.\
- **Neutral Moderation:** Explicitly ensures hint exchanges adhere strictly to predefined guidelines.\

- Explicit satisfaction with identity deduction depth \uc0\u8805  4.5/5.\
- Player-reported effectiveness and fairness of strategic decoys \uc0\u8805  4/5.\
- Explicitly enhanced curiosity and collaboration explicitly rated \uc0\u8805  4.5/5.\
