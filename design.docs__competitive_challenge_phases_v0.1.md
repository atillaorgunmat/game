## \uc0\u55356 \u57263  Competitive Challenge Phase Overview\
Competitive phases explicitly pit Winner and Loser roles against each other through structured logical puzzles, riddles, and cognitive tasks that test critical thinking, strategic sabotage, and identity deduction skills.\
\
## \uc0\u55357 \u56524  Explicit Structure of Competitive Phases\
\
| Phase Name                 | Explicit Gameplay Description                 | Cognitive Challenge Type                | Role-Specific Mechanics |\
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------|\
| **Evidence Analysis Duel** (early-game) | Teams explicitly analyze competing sets of evidence, attempting to identify true vs. false leads quickly. | Pattern recognition, logical deduction | Winner: Register Hypothesis, Sequential Reveal<br>Loser: Plant Decoy Clue, Contradiction Card |\
| **Contradiction Battle** (mid-game)     | Explicit head-to-head introduction of contradictions by Loser, explicit resolution by Winner. | Critical thinking, contradiction resolution | Winner: RCA Fault-Tree, Team Consensus<br>Loser: Contradiction Card, Forced Debate |\
| **Identity Deduction Face-Off** (late mid-game) | Explicit attempt by Winner and Loser to deduce opponent identities, leveraging strategic misdirection. | Identity deduction, strategic deception | All roles: Register Identity Guess, Adaptive Breadcrumbs (AI-mediated) |\
\
## \uc0\u55357 \u56589  Detailed Breakdown by Competitive Phase\
\
### \uc0\u55357 \u56633  Phase 1: Evidence Analysis Duel (~3-8 mins)\
- **Explicit Goal:** Quickly identify legitimate clues vs. Loser-planted decoys.\
- **Winner Actions:**\
  - Use Sequential Reveal explicitly to accelerate clue discovery.\
  - Explicitly validate initial hypotheses via checkpoints.\
- **Loser Actions:**\
  - Explicitly plant decoy clues to mislead early investigations.\
  - Deploy Contradiction Card strategically to slow Winner's progress.\
- **Supporter (AI) Role:**\
  - Impartial broadcasting of clue summaries.\
  - Adaptive breadcrumb deployment triggered by explicit inactivity.\
\
### \uc0\u55357 \u56632  Phase 2: Contradiction Battle (~9-14 mins)\
- **Explicit Goal:** Winner explicitly resolves contradictions introduced by Loser, maintaining RCA clarity.\
- **Winner Actions:**\
  - Explicitly resolve contradictions via Fault-Tree analysis.\
  - Initiate Team Consensus explicitly for validation.\
- **Loser Actions:**\
  - Introduce explicit contradictions to create sustained uncertainty.\
  - Trigger Forced Debate explicitly to burn investigation time.\
- **Supporter (AI) Role:**\
  - Explicitly validates submitted contradictions.\
  - Highlights unresolved contradictions impartially.\
\
### \uc0\u55357 \u56633  Phase 3: Identity Deduction Face-Off (~15-19 mins)\
- **Explicit Goal:** Each role explicitly attempts to identify opponent affiliations to strategically influence final RCA.\
- **Winner Actions:**\
  - Explicitly register identity guesses about Loser to enhance RCA validation.\
- **Loser Actions:**\
  - Explicitly misdirect Winner\'92s identity guesses.\
  - Explicitly register guesses about Winner to enhance sabotage efficacy.\
- **Supporter (AI) Role:**\
  - Explicitly withholds validation of guesses until final reveal.\

## \uc0\u55356 \u57238  Explicit Alignment with Game Pillars\
\
| Pillar                 | Explicit Integration within Competitive Phases |\
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\
| **Curiosity**          | Strategic decoys, contradictions, identity mysteries |\
| **Collaboration**      | Structured team communication, consensus checkpoints |\
| **Root-Cause Analysis**| Explicit logical deduction, structured Fault-Tree analysis |\
\
## \uc0\u55357 \u56420  Explicit Alignment with Player Personas\
\
| Persona              | Explicit Phase Alignment                          | Justification                         |\
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\
| **Curious Collaborator** | Evidence Analysis Duel, Identity Deduction Face-Off | Structured curiosity, social collaboration |\
| **Analytical Achiever**  | Contradiction Battle, Evidence Analysis Duel  | Intellectual mastery, critical thinking |\
| **Social Trickster**     | Identity Deduction Face-Off, Contradiction Battle | Strategic deception, spotlight moments |\
