## \uc0\u55356 \u57263  Explicit Purpose\
Clearly define explicit methods and mechanisms through which real-time gameplay feedback is collected and leveraged to dynamically adapt game difficulty, pacing, and overall player experience.\

\
## \uc0\u55357 \u56580  Explicit Feedback Collection Methods\
\
| Method                  | Explicit Description                      | Trigger Conditions & Frequency       |\
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\
| **Real-Time Analytics** | Automated gameplay data explicitly collected (e.g., time spent, clue usage) | Continuous (every 30 seconds)        |\
| **Player Inputs & Actions** | Explicit monitoring of player interactions and choices | Continuous, event-triggered explicitly |\
| **Explicit Player Requests**| Direct player requests explicitly through UI (e.g., hints requested) | Explicitly player-driven             |\

\
## \uc0\u55357 \u56524  Explicit Adaptation Mechanisms\
\
| Adaptation Mechanism            | Explicit Description & Adjustment                   | Conditions for Explicit Activation   |\
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\
| **Difficulty Adjustment**       | Explicitly scales clue difficulty, puzzle complexity | Based on real-time player success rate explicitly |\
| **Adaptive Hint Frequency**     | Explicitly modifies frequency and clarity of breadcrumbs | Based explicitly on player inactivity and requests |\
| **Contradiction Validation Adjustment**| Explicitly adjusts the difficulty of accepted contradictions | Explicit stagnation detection (over 120 seconds unresolved contradictions) |\
| **Identity Deduction Clarity**  | Explicitly manages clarity or vagueness of identity-related clues | Based explicitly on accuracy of player identity guesses |\

## \uc0\u55357 \u56589  Explicit Feedback-Adaptation Process Overview\
\
### \uc0\u55357 \u56633  Step 1: Continuous Monitoring\
- Explicit real-time collection of analytics data (player progress, inactivity periods, clue usage).\
\
### \uc0\u55357 \u56632  Step 2: Real-Time Analysis\
- Explicit automated AI analysis identifies gameplay friction points, inactivity, and high/low engagement moments explicitly.\
\
### \uc0\u55357 \u56633  Step 3: Adaptive Adjustments\
- AI explicitly makes calculated adjustments to puzzle complexity, hint frequency, and contradiction validation to maintain optimal challenge and engagement explicitly.\
\
### \uc0\u55357 \u56632  Step 4: Player Notification (if necessary)\
- Explicit private UI notifications inform players of significant adaptation adjustments (maintaining transparency).\

| Pillar                 | Explicit Feedback & Adaptation Integration    |\
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\
| **Curiosity**          | Adaptive hints explicitly sustain curiosity-driven engagement and prevent frustration explicitly. |\
| **Collaboration**      | Explicit adaptation in cooperative phases ensures balanced and meaningful participation explicitly. |\
| **Root-Cause Analysis**| Explicit adjustments to difficulty maintain RCA intellectual challenge explicitly. |\
