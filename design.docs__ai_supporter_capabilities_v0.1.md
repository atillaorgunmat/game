## 📌 Explicit AI Supporter Capabilities Overview

| Capability                | Explicit Function                              | Explicit Trigger Conditions        |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Unlock Info Panel**     | Reveals explicitly hidden or locked data panels to aid RCA analysis. | Automatic at scenario checkpoints or hypothesis validations |
| **Broadcast Clue Summary**| Provides explicit concise clue summaries to maintain player clarity and engagement. | Mandatory Communication Phases, explicit inactivity exceeding 60 seconds |
| **Confirm Team Consensus**| Explicitly validates or rejects team consensus submissions. | Explicit RCA Report submission |
| **Adaptive Breadcrumbs**  | Explicitly provides incremental, context-sensitive hints without solving puzzles directly. | Explicit inactivity exceeding 90 seconds, explicit player requests |
| **Highlight Inconsistency** | Explicitly flags submitted contradictions impartially to maintain fairness and gameplay balance. | Explicit submission of Contradiction Cards by Loser role |
| **Validate Identity Guesses** | Explicitly logs and neutrally validates identity guesses, withholding explicit validation results until Final Submission. | Explicit player action: "Register Identity Guess" |
| **Present Tweet Claim** *(new)* | Explicitly presents scenario-opening tweet clearly; logs Winner's explicit stance selection | Explicitly scenario start following initial Winner determination |
| **Log Pre-Statements (new)**    | Explicitly records each player's initial statements; tags explicitly as "verified" until challenged. | Explicitly triggered at the start of each discussion phase. |
| **Echo Pre-Statements (new)**   | Explicitly echoes verbatim Pre-Discussion Statements publicly, clearly ensuring transparency. | Explicitly triggered immediately after Pre-Discussion Statements phase. |
| **Archive Post-Reflections (new)** | Explicitly neutrally archives each player's Post-Discussion Reflections; clearly available for RCA timeline validation. | Explicitly triggered at the end of each discussion phase. |
| **Evaluate Reflection Accuracy (new)** | Explicitly assesses accuracy of Post-Discussion Reflections when challenged by Winner. | Explicitly triggered upon Winner's verification action after Post-Discussion phase. |

## 🔍 Explicit Detailed Breakdown by Capability

### 🔹 Unlock Info Panel
- **Explicit Role**: Facilitate structured RCA explicitly.
- **AI Action**: Explicitly unlock hidden informational panels at predetermined checkpoints.
- **Trigger Conditions**: Explicit scenario milestones, successful hypothesis validations.

### 🔸 Broadcast Clue Summary
- **Explicit Role**: Maintain explicit player clarity and prevent confusion.
- **AI Action**: Clearly broadcasts concise summaries of revealed clues.
- **Trigger Conditions**: Explicit mandatory phases, team communication intervals, prolonged inactivity (>60 seconds).

### 🔹 Confirm Team Consensus
- **Explicit Role**: Ensure explicit RCA consensus validity.
- **AI Action**: Explicitly validates RCA submissions against current evidence explicitly.
- **Trigger Conditions**: Explicit RCA report submissions, consensus popup initiated by Winner.

### 🔸 Adaptive Breadcrumbs
- **Explicit Role**: Sustain player engagement explicitly without direct puzzle solving.
- **AI Action**: Explicitly releases incremental hints tailored to current scenario state.
- **Trigger Conditions**: Explicit team inactivity (>90 seconds), explicit player-driven hint requests.

### 🔹 Highlight Inconsistency
- **Explicit Role**: Ensure fairness explicitly by managing contradictions.
- **AI Action**: Explicitly flags and manages contradiction submissions impartially.
- **Trigger Conditions**: Explicit Loser submission of Contradiction Cards, unresolved contradictions identified explicitly.

### 🔸 Validate Identity Guesses
- **Explicit Role**: Maintain explicit curiosity and strategic identity deduction tension.
- **AI Action**: Explicitly logs guesses, withholding validation explicitly until final submission phase.
- **Trigger Conditions**: Explicit "Register Identity Guess" player action.
