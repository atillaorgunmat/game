## Overview of Team Formation\
Explicitly define how teams form and operate based on player count:\
\
| Player Count | Team Composition                                    | Explicit Role Assignments               |\
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\
| 2 Players    | 1 Winner vs. 1 Loser; AI Supporter present          | Explicit 1:1 competition; AI balances gameplay |\
| 3 Players    | 1 Winner + 1 Investigator vs. 1 Loser; AI Supporter | Investigator aids Winner; Loser balances through sabotage |\
| 4 Players    | 2 Winners (Team) vs. 2 Losers (Team); AI Supporter  | Clear team collaboration; roles within teams balanced |\
| 5+ Players   | Balanced teams of Winners vs. Losers; AI Supporter  | Additional players join as Investigators, evenly distributed |\
\
## Explicit Rules for Scaling and Inclusion\
- Investigator role: No special abilities; explicitly aids Winner's side to maintain balance.\
- Maximum explicit team size: ideally capped at 3 per team to avoid dominant voices.\
- Supporter (AI) explicitly scales hints, breadcrumbs, and contradictions according to player count.\
\
## Explicit Alignment with Personas\
| Persona                | Explicit Benefit                          | Justification                                 |\
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\
| Curious Collaborator   | Small team size, structured communication | Ensures each voice is heard, prevents exclusion |\
| Analytical Achiever    | Explicit Investigator collaboration       | Encourages strategic cooperation and mastery |\
| Social Trickster       | Scalable team competition                 | Provides ample opportunity for spotlight and deception |\
\
## Explicit Alignment with Game Dynamics\
| Dynamic Element        | Explicit Team Scaling Impact              |\
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\
| Competitive Tension    | Enhanced by balanced team sizes (2-4)     |\
| Cooperative Balance    | Structured phases clearly adapted to player count |\
| Social Inclusion       | Small team sizes explicitly maximize contribution |\
\
## KPIs for Team Formation Success\
- Explicit satisfaction with team collaboration \uc0\u8805  4/5\
- Investigator role effectiveness rating \uc0\u8805  4/5\
- Clear balance of win rates (55%-45% \'b110%) maintained across team sizes\
