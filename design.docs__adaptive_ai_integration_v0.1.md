## AI Supporter Role Overview
Explicitly describe how the AI Supporter dynamically interacts with players:

- **Neutral Mediation**: Ensures fairness by impartial data reveals and validations.
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Dynamically adjusts hints and information flow based on real-time player performance.
- **Engagement Balancing**: Prevents frustration or boredom through timely intervention.
- **Identity Validation**: AI explicitly withholds identity guess validations until Final Submission; only flags when max guesses exceeded.



## Explicit Adaptive Mechanisms & Guidelines
| Adaptive Mechanism        | Description                                | Conditions for Trigger |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Adaptive Breadcrumbs**  | Releases incremental, context-sensitive hints | Team inactivity > 90 seconds, or explicit request |
| **Sequential Reveal System** | Adjusts the speed of clue availability     | Player success/failure rates on intermediate goals |
| **Dynamic Contradiction Validation** | Modulates difficulty by accepting/rejecting Loser's contradictions | Ensures fairness, avoids stalemates |
| **Difficulty Ramp-Up/Ramp-Down** | AI scales clue difficulty explicitly during play | Based on observed puzzle-solving speed |
| **Pre-Statement Accuracy Monitor (new)**| Explicitly monitors accuracy of Preloaded False Briefs; dynamically increases frequency and clarity of adaptive hints explicitly to counter persistent unchallenged misinformation explicitly. | Explicit misinformation persistence >120 seconds without explicit Winner challenge |
| **Post-Reflection Validation (new)**    | Explicitly adjusts RCA clue clarity and validation complexity explicitly based on accuracy of Post-Discussion Reflections submitted by players explicitly. | Explicit Winner challenges of reflections accuracy explicitly |


## Explicit AI Interaction per Game Phase
| Phase                     | AI Role & Actions                          |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Initial Reveal**        | Broadcast concise clue summaries; no direct solving |
| **Analysis & Hypothesis** | Provide adaptive breadcrumbs; highlight inconsistencies explicitly |
| **RCA Verification**      | Confirm team consensus clearly; flag contradictions |
| **Final Submission**      | Validate RCA submission impartially and explicitly |

## Alignment with Player Personas
| Persona                | Explicit AI Interaction Alignment           | Justification |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Curious Collaborator   | Clear and frequent breadcrumb hints          | Reduces frustration, sustains engagement |
| Analytical Achiever    | Structured adaptive difficulty scaling       | Maintains intellectual challenge |
| Social Trickster       | Neutral but convincing contradiction validation | Supports fair strategic deception |

## KPIs for AI Integration Success
- Player-rated fairness of AI ≥ 4.5/5
- Adaptive hints and breadcrumbs effectiveness rating ≥ 4/5
- Balanced difficulty satisfaction ≥ 4/5 across personas
