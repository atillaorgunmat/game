## Explicit Player Capabilities Overview
Clearly define strategic intent and optimal use for each role-specific ability:

### ðŸ”¹ Winner Abilities

| Ability                   | Strategic Intent                                         | Optimal Use Timing                 |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Rapid Rebuttal    | Immediately refute one false claim explicitly introduced by Loser. Successful rebuttals grant +15 pts, failures -5 pts. | Explicitly after a contradiction introduced by Loser. Once per analysis phase. |
| Evidence Snapshot *(new)* | Explicitly request AI to protect one crucial truthful evidence node from sabotage for 2 phases. | When explicit protection of a critical clue is needed. Twice per scenario. |
| Data Deep-Dive  | Explicitly receive private detailed identity-related info, boosting Identity Guess bonus (+10 pts if correct). | Explicitly once per scenario during identity deduction phases. |
| Register Hypothesis       | Explicitly validate provisional RCA statements.          | Explicitly at structured checkpoints. |
| Trigger Sequential Reveal | Explicitly accelerate clue discovery.                    | Explicitly during stalled investigation phases. |
| Initiate Team Consensus   | Explicitly secure team alignment on RCA.                 | Explicitly prior to final submission. |
| Verify Baseline Claim     | Explicitly challenge Loser's Preloaded False Brief.      | Explicitly after the Loser's preloaded misinformation. Once per round. |

### ðŸ”¸ Loser Abilities
| Ability                      | Strategic Intent                               | Optimal Use Timing                   |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Play Contradiction Card      | Create explicit uncertainty                    | Mid-game to disrupt RCA clarity      |
| Plant Decoy Clue             | Mislead Winner strategically                   | Early/mid-game sequential reveals    |
| Deploy False Breadcrumb      | Divert attention explicitly                    | Whenever Winner gains momentum       |
| Forge Alternative Hypothesis | Confuse team consensus explicitly              | Late mid-game, pre-submission        |
| Trigger Forced Debate        | Stall explicitly and strategically             | Near critical consensus checkpoints  |
| Register Identity Guess | Explicitly log a hypothesis about opponentâ€™s hidden affiliation; AI validates at end | Optimal in analysis phase |
| Preload False Brief | Explicitly seed AI explicitly with misinformation explicitly tagged as "verified" to mislead RCA | Explicitly at the start of Pre-Discussion Statement phase |



### ðŸ”¹ Supporter (AI) Abilities
| Ability                      | Strategic Intent                               | Optimal AI Trigger Conditions        |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Unlock Info Panel            | Facilitate clear and structured investigation  | Automatically at key checkpoints     |
| Broadcast Clue Summary       | Maintain player engagement explicitly          | During mandatory communication phases|
| Confirm Team Consensus       | Ensure explicit consensus validity             | Upon RCA submission                  |
| Upload Evidence              | Support structured RCA mapping explicitly      | When players register hypotheses     |
| Highlight Inconsistency      | Maintain fairness explicitly                   | Upon contradiction submissions       |
| Register Identity Guess | Explicitly log a hypothesis about opponentâ€™s hidden affiliation; AI validates at end | Optimal in analysis phase |
| Echo & Archive Statements | Explicitly echo Pre-Statements clearly; neutrally archive Post-Reflections explicitly for RCA timeline validation | Explicitly at the start and end of discussion phases |


## Explicit Alignment with Personas
| Persona                | Capability Alignment                           | Explicit Justification |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Curious Collaborator   | Key Abilities (see Unique_Ability_Lists.md for full list)    | Encourages inclusive participation  |
| Analytical Achiever    | Key Abilities (see Unique_Ability_Lists.md for full list)                 | Intellectual mastery & structured validation |
| Social Trickster       | Key Abilities (see Unique_Ability_Lists.md for full list)     | Enables strategic deception, spotlight |


## Explicit Integration with AI Adaptive Systems
- **Adaptive Breadcrumbs** explicitly respond to player capability usage patterns.
- **Dynamic Contradiction Validation** explicitly scales acceptance of contradictions to sustain fairness.

## KPIs for Capabilities Success
- Capability usefulness rating â‰¥ 4/5 (players clearly see strategic value)
- Balanced use-frequency across capabilities (no under-used or over-powered abilities)
- Persona-aligned ability satisfaction â‰¥ 4.5/5
