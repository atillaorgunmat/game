## Explicit Overview of Win Conditions\
Clearly define explicit win conditions for each primary role:\
\
### 
\f1 \uc0\u55357 \u56633 
\f0  Winner Role\
- **Win Condition**: Submit a validated Root-Cause Report within the 20-minute scenario timer:contentReference[oaicite:2]\{index=2\}.\
- **Intermediate Goals**: \
  - Complete sequential clue reveals.\
  - Validate hypotheses at critical checkpoints.\
  - Achieve successful team consensus approvals.\
  - Explicitly register accurate Identity Guesses about the Loser\'92s hidden affiliation, earning bonus evidence panels or additional points toward final victory.\
\
\
### 
\f1 \uc0\u55357 \u56632 
\f0  Loser Role\
- **Win Conditions**: Achieve one of the following explicitly within the 20-minute scenario timer:contentReference[oaicite:3]\{index=3\}:\
  - **Confusion Victory**: Three unresolved contradictions.\
  - **Misdiagnosis Victory**: Winner submits an incorrect RCA.\
  - **Timeout Victory**: RCA not submitted before timer expiry.\
- **Intermediate Goals**:\
  - Plant credible decoy clues.\
  - Effectively execute forced debates and contradiction cards.\
  - Sustain uncertainty and debate.\
  - Strategically mislead Winner's Identity Guesses; gain additional Contradiction Cards when the Winner's guesses are incorrect (max 3 total).\
\
\
### 
\f1 \uc0\u55357 \u56633 
\f0  Supporter Role\
- **Role Purpose**: Explicitly facilitate balanced play, no direct win/lose condition:contentReference[oaicite:4]\{index=4\}.\
- **Intermediate Goals**:\
  - Release timely, balanced breadcrumbs.\
  - Maintain impartiality during consensus checks.\
  - Ensure player engagement remains high.\
  - Explicitly withhold validation of Identity Guesses until Final Submission phase; neutrally validate accuracy at scenario end.\
\
## Explicit Integration with Game Dynamics & Roles\
| Gameplay Phase             | Winner\'92s Goals | Loser\'92s Goals | Supporter\'92s Goals |\
|----------------------------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|\
| **Initial Reveal**         | Map initial clues | Set up initial decoys | Provide balanced clue summary |\
| **Analysis & Hypothesis**  | Validate checkpoints | Introduce contradictions, forced debates | Broadcast timely hints |\
| **Identity Deduction** *(new)* | Register accurate Identity Guesses explicitly     | Mislead or confuse Winner's identity deductions        | Withhold identity validation until end phase |\
| **RCA Verification**       | Achieve consensus | Ensure unresolved contradictions or misdiagnosis | Flag inconsistencies neutrally |\
| **Final Submission**       | Submit accurate RCA | Sustain sabotage through final debate | Confirm consensus or highlight contradictions |\
\
## Explicit Alignment with Personas\
| Persona                | Win Conditions & Goals Alignment           | Explicit Justification |\
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|\
| Curious Collaborator   | Supporter's goals, clear intermediate team goals | Social engagement and inclusivity |\
| Analytical Achiever    | Winner\'92s explicit RCA mastery goal          | Intellectual challenge, satisfaction |\
| Social Trickster       | Loser's explicit sabotage-oriented goals    | Strategic deception, spotlight moments |\
\
## KPIs for Success\
- Explicit clarity rating of win conditions/goals \uc0\u8805  4.5/5 (players know exactly how to win)\
- Balanced win-rates maintained (~55%-45% \'b110%)\
- Role satisfaction rating \uc0\u8805  4/5 (players find their goals motivating and engaging)\
- Explicit accuracy rate for identity deduction \uc0\u8805  50% across multiple games.\
- Players find identity deduction mechanic explicitly enhances curiosity & strategic depth (rated \uc0\u8805  4/5).\
