## \uc0\u55356 \u57263  Explicit Purpose\
Explicitly introduce a dramatic narrative or mechanical twist midway through gameplay to significantly increase player engagement, deepen strategic complexity, and heighten curiosity and social interaction.\
\
---\
\
## \uc0\u55356 \u57261  Explicit Twist Overview: "The Insider Reveal"\
At approximately the midpoint (~10-12 minutes), the AI Supporter explicitly announces a sudden revelation: there is an undisclosed "Insider" among the players secretly aiding the opposing team.\
\
This twist explicitly reframes the ongoing investigation by adding layers of intrigue, suspicion, and accelerated strategic deduction.\

\
## \uc0\u55357 \u56524  Explicit Twist Implementation Steps\
\
### \uc0\u55357 \u56633  Step 1: AI Announcement (~10 min mark)\
- AI explicitly delivers a voice-based general announcement clearly heard by all players:\
  > "Attention teams, we've discovered evidence suggesting an insider is secretly aiding your opponents. You must now explicitly determine who among you cannot be trusted."\
\
### \uc0\u55357 \u56632  Step 2: Mandatory Communication Phase (10-11 mins)\
- Players explicitly enter a structured communication phase, discussing new suspicions explicitly.\
- Each player explicitly shares one previously private identity or capability hint as required by the scenario rules:contentReference[oaicite:0]\{index=0\}:contentReference[oaicite:1]\{index=1\}.\
\
### \uc0\u55357 \u56633  Step 3: Strategic Hint Exchange Adjustment (11-12 mins)\
- Explicit increase in the complexity and strategic importance of hints exchanged.\
- Loser explicitly incentivized to provide strategic decoy hints, enhancing deception.\
- Winner explicitly incentivized to cross-validate received hints for credibility:contentReference[oaicite:2]\{index=2\}.\
\
### \uc0\u55357 \u56632  Step 4: Adaptive AI Adjustment (Continuous from 12 mins onward)\
- AI explicitly increases the frequency and complexity of adaptive breadcrumbs to reflect heightened confusion explicitly.\
- Contradiction validation explicitly adjusted dynamically, making the RCA process explicitly more challenging yet engaging:contentReference[oaicite:3]\{index=3\}:contentReference[oaicite:4]\{index=4\}.\
