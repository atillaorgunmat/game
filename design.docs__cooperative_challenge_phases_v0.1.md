## Explicit Overview of Cooperative Phases
Two explicit cooperative challenge phases designed to foster mandatory collaboration across opposing roles (Winner and Loser), temporarily suspending competitive rivalry to solve global scenario challenges.

### ðŸ”— Phase One: "Digital Decoding" (Mid-Game Cooperative Phase: ~13-15 mins)
- **Challenge Description**: Players explicitly decode a falsified digital broadcast causing widespread confusion.
- **Mandatory Actions**:
  - Explicitly share one withheld clue related to hidden identities.
  - Collaboratively verify digital clues to restore public clarity explicitly.
- **AI Supporter Role**:
  - Explicitly triggers mandatory communication phase.
  - Provides impartial adaptive breadcrumbs to maintain explicit progress.
- **Outcome Impact**:
  - Successful explicit completion grants both roles a temporary boost in clarity, easing immediate competitive tensions.

### ðŸ”— Phase Two: "Crisis Prevention" (Triggered at AI discretion, conditional)
- **Challenge Description**: Explicitly neutralize an AI-identified misinformation "crisis event" that threatens overall scenario viability.
- **Mandatory Actions**:
  - Explicitly suspend rivalry to jointly identify and eliminate key misinformation nodes.
  - Explicitly pool identity deduction insights to validate critical clues.
- **AI Supporter Role**:
  - Explicitly identifies the crisis conditions based on team activity metrics.
  - Dynamically adjusts challenge complexity explicitly based on observed performance and persona-aligned capability usage.
- **Outcome Impact**:
  - Successful explicit collaboration significantly reduces confusion, granting Winner additional time for RCA verification and Loser strategic sabotage opportunities in subsequent phases.

## Explicit Integration with Identity Deduction
- Cooperative phases explicitly require partial revelation of identity-related clues, intensifying curiosity-driven identity deduction.
- Explicit identity deduction accuracy during cooperative phases materially enhances final scenario outcomes.

| Social Trickster     | Strategic leveraging of revealed clues          | Social intrigue, enhanced sabotage depth:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}|

## Explicit Integration with AI Adaptive Systems
- AI explicitly manages communication flow and adaptive breadcrumb deployment to balance cooperative challenge complexity.
- AI explicitly withholds final identity validation, maintaining ongoing strategic tension during cooperative interactions.
