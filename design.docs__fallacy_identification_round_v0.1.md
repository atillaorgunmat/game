## 🎯 Explicit Objective  
Players explicitly compete in an initial round by privately identifying the correct fallacy type from seven provided statements. The round explicitly determines initial roles (Winner and Loser). After explicit completion of the Fallacy Identification Round, proceed explicitly with the initial tweet stance selection phase.

---

## 🗂 Explicit Fallacy Pool
Players explicitly select from the following seven fallacy types:

1. **Anchoring**  
2. **Authority Bias**  
3. **Strawman**  
4. **Ad Hominem**  
5. **Confirmation Bias**  
6. **Slippery Slope**  
7. **False Dilemma**

## 📌 Explicit Round Structure & Mechanics

### 🔹 Step 1: Setup & AI Introduction
- AI explicitly introduces the seven fallacy types clearly to all players.

### 🔸 Step 2: Fallacy Statement Presentation
- AI explicitly presents seven short statements, each embedding exactly one fallacy type clearly.
- Players explicitly see these statements one at a time in a clear, numbered list.

### 🔹 Step 3: Explicit Player Selection
- Players explicitly select the fallacy type privately for each statement, via simple UI interactions.
- Explicit private selection ensures no player bias influenced by another’s choices.

### 🔸 Step 4: Explicit AI Validation
- AI explicitly and neutrally validates player selections against correct fallacy answers internally stored.
- Explicit scoring clearly tallied per player (one point per correct fallacy identification).

### 🔹 Step 5: Results & Initial Role Assignment
- AI explicitly announces results (correct answers per player).
- Roles explicitly determined:
  - Player(s) explicitly with highest correct answers: **Winner**
  - Player(s) explicitly with lowest correct answers: **Loser**
- Explicit tie-breaker mechanic: "Sudden-death" additional fallacy statement explicitly provided until Winner/Loser differentiation explicitly achieved.
