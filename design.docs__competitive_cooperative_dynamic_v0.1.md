## Dynamic Overview
- Clearly describe how the competitive-cooperative balance explicitly drives engagement, excitement, and social interaction.

## Explicit Game Phases and Dynamics Mapping
| Game Phase                  | Explicit Dynamics                           | Justification / Impact                     |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Initial Reveal**          | Cooperative (full-team introduction)         | Ensures inclusive start, sets collaboration tone |
| **Pre-Discussion Statements** *(new)* | Explicit Competitive spark (truth vs. deceptive brief) | Clearly defines explicit competitive stance-setting before team interaction, enhancing strategic depth and tension explicitly |
| **Post-Discussion Reflections** *(new)* | Explicit Competitive-Cooperative (truthful summaries vs. strategic deceptions) | Explicitly enhances strategic reflection and post-analysis sabotage opportunities clearly |
| **Team Analysis & Hypothesis** | Competitive + Cooperative (rivalry-driven clue analysis + mandatory comms) | Balances rivalry with structured collaboration |
| **Team Analysis & Hypothesis** | Competitive + Cooperative + Identity Deduction | Adds strategic deduction about opponent identities |
| **Mid-Game Cooperative Phase** | Fully Cooperative (mandatory global puzzle solving) | Provides social relief, deepens interpersonal bonds |
| **RCA Verification**        | Competitive (each side drives toward their win state) | Heightens competitive tension, intellectual challenge |
| **Final Submission**        | Competitive (winner-takes-all climax)       | Dramatic, satisfying resolution |


## Explicit Integration of Game Elements
| Gameplay Element              | Explicit Role in Competitive/Cooperative Balance |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Forced Debate (Loser role)**| Temporarily disrupts collaboration; increases tension |
| **Team Consensus Mechanism**  | Structured collaboration; balances competitive pressure |
| **Contradiction Cards**       | Competitive tension; encourages cooperative counter-strategy |
| **Adaptive Breadcrumbs**      | Fosters cooperative problem-solving; balances frustration |
| **Sequential Reveal**         | Balances competitive information races with cooperative exploration |

## Alignment with Player Personas
| Persona                | Explicit Element Alignment           | Reasoning                             |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Curious Collaborator** | Mid-Game Cooperative Phase          | Ensures social relatedness, inclusive engagement |
| **Analytical Achiever**  | Competitive RCA Verification        | Satisfies intellectual challenge and mastery |
| **Social Trickster**     | Forced Debate, Contradiction Cards  | Provides spotlight moments and social intrigue |

## KPIs for Competitive-Cooperative Balance
- Player-reported enjoyment of both cooperative and competitive phases ≥ 4/5
- Cooperative phase success rate ≥ 80% across diverse player groups
- Explicit competitive tension rated ≥ 4/5 (without negative stress)
