## Dynamic Overview\
- Clearly describe how the competitive-cooperative balance explicitly drives engagement, excitement, and social interaction.\
\
## Explicit Game Phases and Dynamics Mapping\
| Game Phase                  | Explicit Dynamics                           | Justification / Impact                     |\
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\
| **Initial Reveal**          | Cooperative (full-team introduction)         | Ensures inclusive start, sets collaboration tone |\
| **Team Analysis & Hypothesis** | Competitive + Cooperative (rivalry-driven clue analysis + mandatory comms) | Balances rivalry with structured collaboration |\

\cf0 | **Team Analysis & Hypothesis** | Competitive + Cooperative + Identity Deduction | Adds strategic deduction about opponent identities |\

\cf0 | **Mid-Game Cooperative Phase** | Fully Cooperative (mandatory global puzzle solving) | Provides social relief, deepens interpersonal bonds |\
| **RCA Verification**        | Competitive (each side drives toward their win state) | Heightens competitive tension, intellectual challenge |\
| **Final Submission**        | Competitive (winner-takes-all climax)       | Dramatic, satisfying resolution |\
\
## Explicit Integration of Game Elements\
| Gameplay Element              | Explicit Role in Competitive/Cooperative Balance |\
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\
| **Forced Debate (Loser role)**| Temporarily disrupts collaboration; increases tension |\
| **Team Consensus Mechanism**  | Structured collaboration; balances competitive pressure |\
| **Contradiction Cards**       | Competitive tension; encourages cooperative counter-strategy |\
| **Adaptive Breadcrumbs**      | Fosters cooperative problem-solving; balances frustration |\
| **Sequential Reveal**         | Balances competitive information races with cooperative exploration |\
\
## Alignment with Player Personas\
| Persona                | Explicit Element Alignment           | Reasoning                             |\
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\
| **Curious Collaborator** | Mid-Game Cooperative Phase          | Ensures social relatedness, inclusive engagement |\
| **Analytical Achiever**  | Competitive RCA Verification        | Satisfies intellectual challenge and mastery |\
| **Social Trickster**     | Forced Debate, Contradiction Cards  | Provides spotlight moments and social intrigue |\
\
## KPIs for Competitive-Cooperative Balance\
- Player-reported enjoyment of both cooperative and competitive phases \uc0\u8805  4/5\
- Cooperative phase success rate \uc0\u8805  80% across diverse player groups\
- Explicit competitive tension rated \uc0\u8805  4/5 (without negative stress)\
