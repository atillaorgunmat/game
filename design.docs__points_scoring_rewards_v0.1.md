## ðŸŽ¯ Explicit Purpose
Clearly define explicit mechanisms for scoring points, tracking performance, and providing immediate feedback and rewards to players, ensuring sustained engagement and competitive balance.

## ðŸ“Œ Explicit Scoring System Overview

| Action Type                 | Explicit Points Awarded                  | Description & Conditions                |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Clue Discovery**          | 10 points per explicitly discovered clue | Sequential reveals explicitly triggered |
| **Successful Hypothesis**   | 20 points per validated hypothesis       | Explicitly validated at RCA checkpoints |
| **Contradiction Resolution**| 15 points per resolved contradiction     | Explicitly confirmed via Fault-Tree interface |
| **Identity Guess (Correct)**| 25 points per accurate identity guess    | Explicitly validated at Final Submission |
| **Cooperative Challenge Success**| 30 points for explicit cooperative phase success | Explicitly collaborative puzzle resolution |
| **Final RCA Submission**    | 50 points for explicitly validated RCA   | Explicit final report submission & validation |
| **Tweet Stance Proven**  | +25 points explicitly | Explicit successful RCA supporting Winner-selected stance |
| **Tweet Stance Rebutted** *(new)*| Winner explicitly -15 points; Loser explicitly +15 points | Explicit successful sabotage contradicting Winner stance |
| Truthful Pre-Statement Confirmed | +10 points (role who posted)          | Pre-Discussion Statement proven accurate during RCA |
| False Brief Exposed         | Winner +15 / Loser â€“10                  | Loser's preloaded false brief explicitly identified and discredited |
| Deceptive Post-Reflection Exposed | Winner +10 / Loser â€“5                | Loser's false summary or reflection exposed by Winner in Post-Discussion phase |
| Truthful Post-Reflection Confirmed | +5 points (role who posted)         | Playerâ€™s post-discussion summary confirmed accurate during RCA |
| Rapid Rebuttal (new)   | +15 pts / â€“5 pts        | Explicit success/failure of immediate rebuttal |
| Evidence Snapshot (new)| +10 pts protection bonus| Explicitly protects one clue for two phases  |
| Data Deep-Dive (new)   | +10 pts                 | Explicitly bonus for accurate identity guess |

## ðŸŽ– Explicit Reward Structure

| Reward Type              | Explicit Trigger Condition                 | Explicit Benefit                         |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Bonus Clue Reveal**    | Explicitly every 50 cumulative points      | Additional explicit identity or RCA clue |
| **Adaptive Hint Boost**  | Explicitly activated at 100 cumulative points| Enhanced adaptive breadcrumb frequency explicitly |
| **Identity Insight Boost**| Explicitly activated by accurate identity guess | Explicit additional identity deduction hints |
| **Strategic Bonus**      | Explicit cooperative phase successful completion | Explicit time extension for RCA verification |

## ðŸŽ– Explicit Integration with Game Pillars

| Pillar                 | Explicit Scoring & Reward Alignment           |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Curiosity**          | Rewards explicitly sustain ongoing curiosity and exploration |
| **Collaboration**      | Points explicitly awarded for successful cooperative challenges |
| **Root-Cause Analysis**| Points explicitly structured around successful RCA checkpoints |

## ðŸ‘¥ Explicit Alignment with Player Personas

| Persona                | Explicit Scoring & Rewards Alignment          | Justification                             |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Curious Collaborator** | Cooperative challenge rewards explicitly     | Explicitly encourages social engagement and teamwork |
| **Analytical Achiever**  | Explicit hypothesis & RCA rewards            | Clearly supports intellectual mastery explicitly |
| **Social Trickster**     | Identity guess rewards explicitly            | Explicitly enhances strategic deception and spotlight |

## ðŸ¤– Explicit AI Supporter Role in Scoring & Rewards
- Explicitly validates and allocates points impartially.
- Explicitly triggers adaptive hints and rewards based on cumulative points.
- Provides explicit feedback on point status privately via UI notifications.
