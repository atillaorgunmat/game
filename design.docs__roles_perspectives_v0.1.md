- Persona Alignment: Analytical Achiever (primary), Curious Collaborator (secondary).
- Upon role assignment, explicitly select whether the initial tweet claim is **"True" or "False"**. Your RCA explicitly must support your selected stance through the scenario.

	â€¢	Objective: Facilitate balanced gameplay and fair competition (no direct win/loss condition).
	â€¢	Key Abilities: Unlock Info Panel, Broadcast Clue Summary, Adaptive Breadcrumbs.
	â€¢	Explicit Deduction Mechanic: Validates registered identity guesses impartially, withholding results until the Final Submission phase to maintain gameplay fairness and curiosity.
	â€¢	Motivations: Social fulfillment, team contribution, impartial mediation.
	â€¢	Persona Alignment: Curious Collaborator (primary), Analytical Achiever & Social Trickster (secondary).
