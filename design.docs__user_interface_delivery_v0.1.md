## üéØ Explicit Purpose
Clearly define explicit guidelines for the game's user interface (UI), interaction design, and content delivery methods, ensuring accessibility, ease of use, and optimal user engagement across various device capabilities.

## üìå Explicit Interface & Delivery Overview

| UI Component            | Explicit Purpose & Description              | Delivery Format                         |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|+**Primary Game Interface**| Core interactions via **chat commands + evidence chart** (`/hypo`, `/rebut`, `/snapshot`, etc.); desktop view shows a compact tree diagram generated by AI | Text/chat-first; minimal graphics |
|+**Round Timer Bar**| Visual countdown for each 120 s analysis round and 30 s Quick Choice window | Text progress bar (low-BW) or animated bar (rich) |
|+**Interpretation Token Tray**| Shows each team‚Äôs Truth / Partial / False choice per tweet round | Slash-command `/token <truth|partial|false>`; drag-and-drop on web |
| **Private Notifications**| Explicitly provide role-specific clues, identity validations, and adaptive hints | Discreet UI prompts explicitly |
| **AI Announcements**    | Explicitly deliver global updates, game-phase transitions, and key events | Clear AI-generated voice explicitly |
| **Accessibility Features**| Explicitly accommodate low-bandwidth users and simple interfaces | Lightweight text-based UI explicitly |

## üîç Explicit Detailed UI Components

### üîπ Primary Game Interface
- **Explicit Design**:
  - Clean, minimalist, chat/text-based interface explicitly.
  - Clearly labeled interactive elements (buttons, links) explicitly.
  - Evidence Chart (/hypo):** players enter numbered checkpoints; AI tags each **Likely / Uncertain / Contradicted**.
  - Quick-ref commands: `/rebut`, `/snapshot`, `/deepdive`, `/hypo`, `/reveal`, `/consensus`, `/verify`.

- **Accessibility Considerations**:
  - Explicitly optimized for low-spec mobile devices and intermittent network conditions explicitly:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
  - Clear, Grade 8 readability text explicitly.

### üî∏ Private Notifications
- **Explicit Design**:
  - Clearly delineated private UI messages.
  - Explicit notifications marked as "Private" visually.
- **Accessibility Considerations**:
  - Text-only explicit notifications for minimal bandwidth explicitly.

### üîπ AI Announcements
- **Explicit Design**:
  - Concise, clearly enunciated voice messages explicitly.
  - Explicit repetition of key points at critical junctures.
- **Accessibility Considerations**:
  - Volume-adjustable explicitly; subtitles option available.

## üéñ Explicit Integration with Game Pillars

| Pillar                 | Explicit UI & Delivery Alignment              |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Curiosity**          | UI explicitly supports incremental curiosity-driven clue reveals. |
| **Collaboration**      | Interface explicitly structured around clear, structured player communication. |
| **Root-Cause Analysis**| RCA interface explicitly simplifies complex data mapping explicitly. |

## üë• Explicit Alignment with Player Personas

| Persona                | Explicit UI & Delivery Alignment              | Justification                                 |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Curious Collaborator** | Simple UI, clear announcements explicitly     | Explicitly ensures inclusive participation and prevents overwhelm |
| **Analytical Achiever**  | RCA fault-tree visualization explicitly clear | Explicit intellectual satisfaction through structured clarity |
| **Social Trickster**     | Private notifications, clearly marked explicitly | Explicitly enhances strategic social interactions |
