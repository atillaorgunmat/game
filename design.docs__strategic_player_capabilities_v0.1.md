## Explicit Player Capabilities Overview\
Clearly define strategic intent and optimal use for each role-specific ability:\
\
### \uc0\u55357 \u56633  Winner Abilities\
| Ability                      | Strategic Intent                               | Optimal Use Timing                   |\
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\
| Map Causes                   | Structure RCA explicitly                      | Early & Mid-game to maintain clarity |\
| Register Hypothesis          | Validate and secure evidence explicitly        | Checkpoints (mid-game & verification phase) |\
| Trigger Sequential Reveal    | Accelerate explicit clue discovery             | Stalled analysis phases              |\
| Initiate Team Consensus      | Secure explicit team alignment                 | Before final submission              |\
| Submit RCA Report            | Achieve explicit victory condition             | Final game phase (last-minute confirmation) |\
\
### \uc0\u55357 \u56632  Loser Abilities\
| Ability                      | Strategic Intent                               | Optimal Use Timing                   |\
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\
| Play Contradiction Card      | Create explicit uncertainty                    | Mid-game to disrupt RCA clarity      |\
| Plant Decoy Clue             | Mislead Winner strategically                   | Early/mid-game sequential reveals    |\
| Deploy False Breadcrumb      | Divert attention explicitly                    | Whenever Winner gains momentum       |\
| Forge Alternative Hypothesis | Confuse team consensus explicitly              | Late mid-game, pre-submission        |\
| Trigger Forced Debate        | Stall explicitly and strategically             | Near critical consensus checkpoints  |\
\
### \uc0\u55357 \u56633  Supporter (AI) Abilities\
| Ability                      | Strategic Intent                               | Optimal AI Trigger Conditions        |\
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\
| Unlock Info Panel            | Facilitate clear and structured investigation  | Automatically at key checkpoints     |\
| Broadcast Clue Summary       | Maintain player engagement explicitly          | During mandatory communication phases|\
| Confirm Team Consensus       | Ensure explicit consensus validity             | Upon RCA submission                  |\
| Upload Evidence              | Support structured RCA mapping explicitly      | When players register hypotheses     |\
| Highlight Inconsistency      | Maintain fairness explicitly                   | Upon contradiction submissions       |\
\
## Explicit Alignment with Personas\
| Persona                | Capability Alignment                           | Explicit Justification |\
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\
| Curious Collaborator   | Broadcast Clue Summary, Adaptive Breadcrumbs    | Encourages inclusive participation  |\
| Analytical Achiever    | Map Causes, Register Hypothesis                 | Intellectual mastery & structured validation |\
| Social Trickster       | Contradiction Card, Forced Debate               | Enables strategic deception, spotlight |\
\
## Explicit Integration with AI Adaptive Systems\
- **Adaptive Breadcrumbs** explicitly respond to player capability usage patterns.\
- **Dynamic Contradiction Validation** explicitly scales acceptance of contradictions to sustain fairness.\
\
## KPIs for Capabilities Success\
- Capability usefulness rating \uc0\u8805  4/5 (players clearly see strategic value)\
- Balanced use-frequency across capabilities (no under-used or over-powered abilities)\
- Persona-aligned ability satisfaction \uc0\u8805  4.5/5\
