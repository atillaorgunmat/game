## üéØ Explicit Purpose
Clearly define explicit design, structure, and mechanics of logical chain puzzles and Root-Cause Analysis (RCA) challenges, explicitly ensuring cognitive engagement, sustained curiosity, and intellectual challenge.

---

## üìå Explicit Logical Chain Puzzle Structure

### üîó Explicit Puzzle Design Principles:
- **Incremental Complexity:** Explicitly designed to gradually increase puzzle complexity.
- **Multiple Paths:** At least two explicit valid solution paths for each logical puzzle.
- **Persona-Aligned Clues:** Explicitly tailored to match persona-specific motivations and capabilities.

---

### üîç Explicit RCA Challenge Mechanics:
- **Evidence Chart (/hypo):** Players log numbered Hypothesis Checkpoints with the /hypo command. The AI labels each checkpoint Likely / Uncertain / Contradicted and threads the chain automatically.
- **Hypothesis Checkpoints:** Explicit hypothesis validations at defined checkpoints, guided and explicitly validated by AI.
- **Explicit Contradiction Management:** Loser explicitly introduces contradictions; Winner explicitly resolves via logical deduction.

---

## üìñ Example Explicit Logical Chain Puzzle

### Puzzle: "Misinformation Web"
- **Objective:** Explicitly identify root misinformation source causing scenario confusion.
- **Chain Structure:** 
  1. Explicitly decode digital clue revealing partial identity information.
  2. Cross-reference explicitly revealed clue with private identity notification.
  3. Explicitly record Hypothesis Checkpoints (`/hypo`) to map misinformation sources in the Evidence Chart.

  4. Explicitly validate hypotheses at structured AI-supported checkpoints.
- **AI Interaction:**
  - Explicit adaptive breadcrumb hints triggered by explicit player inactivity or request.
  - Highlight explicitly unresolved contradictions clearly.

### Puzzle: "Tweet-to-Evidence Trace" (New)

- **Objective:**  
  Explicitly validate (or invalidate) the Winner‚Äôs chosen tweet stance ("True" or "False") by logically tracing supporting and contradicting evidence throughout the scenario.

- **Chain Structure:**  
### Step‚ÄØ0 ‚Äì Apply Pre‚ÄëDiscussion Action Card
Before any clues are analysed, execute the Action Card chosen during the Pre‚ÄëDiscussion phase
(see `pre_discussion_action_menu_v0.1.md`).  
*Example:* The Loser plays **False‚ÄØBrief** ‚Üí AI injects the fabricated fact and tags it ‚Äúverified‚Äù.


  1. **Tweet Stance Selection:**  
     Winner explicitly selects a stance (True/False) for the opening tweet announced by the AI.
  2. **Initial Evidence Collection:**  
     All players gather clues, explicitly focusing on those most relevant to the tweet‚Äôs claim and truth status.
  3. **Intermediate Verification Checkpoints:**  
     At pre-set analysis milestones, teams must explicitly synthesize findings and justify alignment (or misalignment) with the selected stance.
  4. **Contradiction & Decoy Management:**  
     Loser explicitly introduces contradictions and decoy evidence to undermine the Winner‚Äôs stance; Winner must resolve contradictions via the Fault-Tree.
  5. **Evidence Snapshot Immunity:**  If the Winner has an active **Evidence Snapshot**, the protected clue cannot be targeted by Contradiction Cards for the next **two Analysis Phases**.

6. **Explicit Integration of Post-Discussion Reflections**  
   - Players explicitly incorporate Post-Discussion Reflections explicitly logged after discussions into RCA Fault-Tree explicitly.
   - Winner explicitly evaluates truthfulness of reflections; Loser explicitly attempts deception validation explicitly.
   - AI explicitly archives reflections neutrally, explicitly influencing RCA consensus and final logical deduction explicitly.
  7. **Final RCA Synthesis:**  
     All evidence is explicitly mapped in the Fault-Tree to prove (or disprove) the stance. The Final RCA Report must clearly justify how the evidence supports or undermines the tweet.

- **AI Interaction:**  
  - AI announces the tweet and records the Winner‚Äôs stance.  
  - AI releases supporting/contradictory clues as needed (adaptive breadcrumbs).  
  - AI validates checkpoints and final RCA alignment.

- **Integration Points:**  
  - Final RCA validation is contingent on the logical consistency of the stance-evidence chain.
  - The Winner‚Äôs success is explicitly tied to proof of the chosen stance, while the Loser wins by causing critical contradiction or misdiagnosis.

## Evidence Match Mini-Round (v0.2)

**Purpose:**  
Enable precise Root-Cause Analysis by directly linking tweet claims to specific pieces of article-based evidence.

**Gameplay Flow:**  

| Step | Actor | Action | Duration |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **AI Supporter** | Presents tweet and three labeled evidence snippets (**A**, **B**, **C**). | - |
| 2 | **Both teams** | Conduct private whisper discussion to evaluate evidence. | 30 seconds |
| 3 | **Winner** | Uses `/evidence A|B|C` command to lock in the team's selection. | 15 seconds |
| 4 | **Loser** *(optional)* | Plays `/decoylink URL` (usable once per match) to introduc
