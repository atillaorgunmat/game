## üéØ Explicit Purpose
Clearly define how communication explicitly occurs within gameplay, emphasizing player-to-player dialogue, general AI announcements, and UI-based private notifications.

## üìå Explicit Communication Channels Overview

| Communication Channel    | Description                               | Explicit Delivery Method       |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Player-to-Player**     | Primary explicit dialogue among players for collaboration, identity deduction, and strategic interactions | Voice/Chat (player-driven)     |
| **AI General Announcements** | Explicit global game updates, scenario progress updates, and key event alerts for all players collectively | Voice-based (AI-driven)        |
| **Private Notifications**| Explicit confidential and personalized updates, including role-specific clues and private identity deduction outcomes | UI/Text (AI-delivered privately) |

---

### üî∏ Pre-Discussion Statements (Explicitly Mandatory)
- **Explicit Purpose:** Players clearly set initial stance, intentions, or deceptions explicitly before any discussions.
- **Activities:**
  - Winner explicitly frames an initial hypothesis clearly.
  - Loser explicitly preloads false briefs through AI clearly as truthful.
- **Delivery Method:** 
  - Clearly via private UI inputs (text-based), explicitly visible publicly afterward through AI announcements.
- **KPIs:**
  - Explicit player clarity rating ‚â• 4.5/5.
  - Strategic depth explicitly enhanced, rated ‚â• 4.5/5.

---

### üîπ Post-Discussion Reflections (Explicitly Mandatory)
- **Explicit Purpose:** Clearly allows players to log truthful reflections or deliberate deceptions explicitly after discussions.
- **Activities:**
  - Winner explicitly logs a truthful summary of discussion outcomes clearly.
  - Loser explicitly logs deceptions clearly designed to undermine RCA integrity.
- **Delivery Method:** 
  - Clearly through private UI input explicitly logged by AI; publicly available through AI summaries afterward.
- **KPIs:**
  - Strategic effectiveness explicitly rated ‚â• 4.5/5.
  - Explicit clarity rating ‚â• 4.5/5.

## üîç Detailed Breakdown by Communication Channel

### üîπ Player-to-Player Communication
- **Explicit Purpose:** Central explicit mechanism for collaboration, strategic deception, and identity deduction interactions.
- **Activities:** 
  - Players explicitly engage in dialogue for hypothesis validation, strategic debates, and collaborative puzzle-solving.
- **Delivery Method:** 
  - Explicitly via voice or chat, player-initiated and controlled.
- **KPIs:** 
  - Player-reported ease and effectiveness explicitly ‚â• 4.5/5.
  - Inclusive participation explicitly rated ‚â• 4.5/5.

---

### üî∏ AI General Announcements
- **Explicit Purpose:** Provide explicit scenario-wide updates, important time checkpoints, and global event notifications.
- **Activities:** 
  - Explicit announcements at scenario start/end, phase transitions, cooperative phases, and major puzzle resolutions.
  - Initial tweet explicitly announced publicly.
  - Winner‚Äôs explicit tweet stance choice ("True" or "False") clearly broadcast to all players.
  - "AI explicitly prompts **Pre-Statement phase** and **Post-Reflection phase** transitions clearly at appropriate intervals."


- **Delivery Method:** 
  - Explicitly via voice announcements (AI-generated) heard clearly by all players simultaneously.
- **KPIs:** 
  - Explicit clarity and helpfulness rating ‚â• 4.5/5.
  - Explicit timely announcements satisfaction ‚â• 4.5/5.

---

### üîπ Private Notifications (UI/Text-based)
- **Explicit Purpose:** Deliver explicit confidential information, personalized role-specific clues, and private validation of identity deductions.
- **Activities:** 
  - Explicit private confirmations for identity guesses, individual clue reveals, and personalized adaptive breadcrumbs.
- **Delivery Method:** 
  - Explicitly through discrete UI prompts or text notifications visible privately only to individual recipients.
- **KPIs:** 
  - Player satisfaction with confidentiality explicitly ‚â• 4.5/5.
  - Explicit effectiveness in supporting player strategy ‚â• 4.5/5.

## üéñ Explicit Integration with Game Pillars

| Pillar                 | Explicit Communication Channel Alignment       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Curiosity**          | Private Notifications explicitly sustain curiosity-driven identity deduction. |
| **Collaboration**      | Player-to-player dialogue explicitly fosters teamwork and cooperation. |
| **Root-Cause Analysis**| AI General Announcements explicitly keep players aligned and informed on RCA progress. |

---

## üë• Explicit Alignment with Player Personas

| Persona                | Explicit Channel Alignment                  | Justification                               |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Curious Collaborator** | AI announcements, structured player dialogue | Maintains inclusive and clear participation explicitly |
| **Analytical Achiever**  | Private UI Notifications, structured team interactions | Explicitly supports structured intellectual mastery |
| **Social Trickster**     | Player-to-player strategic interactions explicitly | Explicitly provides platform for strategic deception and spotlight |
