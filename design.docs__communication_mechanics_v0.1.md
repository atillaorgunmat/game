## \uc0\u55356 \u57263  Explicit Purpose\
Clearly define how communication explicitly occurs within gameplay, emphasizing player-to-player dialogue, general AI announcements, and UI-based private notifications.\

\
## \uc0\u55357 \u56524  Explicit Communication Channels Overview\
\
| Communication Channel    | Description                               | Explicit Delivery Method       |\
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\
| **Player-to-Player**     | Primary explicit dialogue among players for collaboration, identity deduction, and strategic interactions | Voice/Chat (player-driven)     |\
| **AI General Announcements** | Explicit global game updates, scenario progress updates, and key event alerts for all players collectively | Voice-based (AI-driven)        |\
| **Private Notifications**| Explicit confidential and personalized updates, including role-specific clues and private identity deduction outcomes | UI/Text (AI-delivered privately) |\

\
## \uc0\u55357 \u56589  Detailed Breakdown by Communication Channel\
\
### \uc0\u55357 \u56633  Player-to-Player Communication\
- **Explicit Purpose:** Central explicit mechanism for collaboration, strategic deception, and identity deduction interactions.\
- **Activities:** \
  - Players explicitly engage in dialogue for hypothesis validation, strategic debates, and collaborative puzzle-solving.\
- **Delivery Method:** \
  - Explicitly via voice or chat, player-initiated and controlled.\
- **KPIs:** \
  - Player-reported ease and effectiveness explicitly \uc0\u8805  4.5/5.\
  - Inclusive participation explicitly rated \uc0\u8805  4.5/5.\
\
---\
\
### \uc0\u55357 \u56632  AI General Announcements\
- **Explicit Purpose:** Provide explicit scenario-wide updates, important time checkpoints, and global event notifications.\
- **Activities:** \
  - Explicit announcements at scenario start/end, phase transitions, cooperative phases, and major puzzle resolutions.\
- **Delivery Method:** \
  - Explicitly via voice announcements (AI-generated) heard clearly by all players simultaneously.\
- **KPIs:** \
  - Explicit clarity and helpfulness rating \uc0\u8805  4.5/5.\
  - Explicit timely announcements satisfaction \uc0\u8805  4.5/5.\
\
---\
\
### \uc0\u55357 \u56633  Private Notifications (UI/Text-based)\
- **Explicit Purpose:** Deliver explicit confidential information, personalized role-specific clues, and private validation of identity deductions.\
- **Activities:** \
  - Explicit private confirmations for identity guesses, individual clue reveals, and personalized adaptive breadcrumbs.\
- **Delivery Method:** \
  - Explicitly through discrete UI prompts or text notifications visible privately only to individual recipients.\
- **KPIs:** \
  - Player satisfaction with confidentiality explicitly \uc0\u8805  4.5/5.\
  - Explicit effectiveness in supporting player strategy \uc0\u8805  4.5/5.\

## \uc0\u55356 \u57238  Explicit Integration with Game Pillars\
\
| Pillar                 | Explicit Communication Channel Alignment       |\
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\
| **Curiosity**          | Private Notifications explicitly sustain curiosity-driven identity deduction. |\
| **Collaboration**      | Player-to-player dialogue explicitly fosters teamwork and cooperation. |\
| **Root-Cause Analysis**| AI General Announcements explicitly keep players aligned and informed on RCA progress. |\
\
---\
\
## \uc0\u55357 \u56421  Explicit Alignment with Player Personas\
\
| Persona                | Explicit Channel Alignment                  | Justification                               |\
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\
| **Curious Collaborator** | AI announcements, structured player dialogue | Maintains inclusive and clear participation explicitly |\
| **Analytical Achiever**  | Private UI Notifications, structured team interactions | Explicitly supports structured intellectual mastery |\
| **Social Trickster**     | Player-to-player strategic interactions explicitly | Explicitly provides platform for strategic deception and spotlight |\
